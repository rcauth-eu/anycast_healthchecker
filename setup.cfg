summary = A healthchecker for Anycasted Services
description = Anycast-healthchecker monitors a service by doing periodic health
              checks and based on the result instructs Bird daemon to either
              advertise or withdraw the route to reach the monitored service. As
              a result Bird will only advertise routes for healthy services.

              Bird must be configured in a certain way to interface properly
              with anycast-healthchecker.

              Anycast-healthchecker is a Python program, which uses the daemon
              library to implement a well-behaved Unix daemon process and
              threading to run multiple service checks in parallel.
